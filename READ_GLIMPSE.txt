# GLIMPSE Example Snakemake Workflow

## Overview

This workflow provides an end-to-end example of an imputation with GLIMPSE. The only dependency required is snakemake itself (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#:~:text=Installation%20via%20Conda%2FMamba%20%C2%B6%201%20Full%20installation%20%C2%B6,on%20Bioconda%20as%20a%20package%20source%20%C2%B6%20).

Broadly, the pipeline needs to be run in 4 steps. 

1. Build glimpse reference panel.
2. (Optional) Rename chr (eg., 1 to chr1), this depends on input reference genome being used. 
3. Genearte chunk files from the reference genomes.
4. Run the imputation script.


The script assumes sample genome has already been aligned to the human reference genome (hg38), sorted, and duplicates been marked. 

Building reference panel and renaming chr, needs to be done only once unless changing the input reference panel. 

Detailed steps:

1. SAMPLES and DIR are hardcoded. Something that can be changed depending on the samples, a python code can be added to this script.   
2. In case samples are subsampled, add the coverage info and add it to the code that follows. 
3. Create the glimpse imputation panel.
4. For each coverage, call variants with BCFtools. 
5. Perform low-coverage WGS with GLIMPSE. 

To build reference panel:
snakemake -s build_glimpse_panel_sm.smk -c128

To rename chr:
snakemake -s chrNameChange.smk -c128

To make chunks:
snakemake -s Make_chunks_sm.smk -c128

To run glimpse:
snakemake -s Snakefile_sm_06302023_.smk -c128
